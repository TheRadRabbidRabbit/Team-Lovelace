    <div><p>Welcome to Gabe's Minigame</p></div>
    <div><p>This minigame relates to the College Board 3.11 topic: Binary Search. Binary search is a searching method used to locate
    an item in a sorted list that is faster than a linear search. It works by dividing the list in half, then searching the half with the
    item by dividing it in half again until only the key term is left.</p></div>
    <br><br>
    <div><p>Try to guess the random number between 1 and 100 in as few guesses as possible by using this method!</p></div>
