# Contributing Guidelines
1. Before contributing, make sure you are not working on the same file as someone else. You can check the [Scrum Board](https://github.com/TheRadRabbidRabbit/Team-Lovelace/projects/1) to get an idea of what each team member is working on.
2. If you are interested in working on something that is not currently a backlog issue, create an issue. Add a checklist that breaks down the steps required for the task.
3. After every session of work, pull first. After pulling, you may commit your code. Do not commit code with errors/that doesn't function properly.
4. Once you've completed your tasks, check them off on your issue.
5. When finished with your issue, close the issue and move it to the correct column on the Scrum Board.

Thank you for contributing to Team Lovelace's project!
