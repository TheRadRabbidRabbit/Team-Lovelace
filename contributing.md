# Contributing Guidelines
1. Before contributing, make sure you are not working on the same file as someone else. You can check the [Scrum Board](https://github.com/TheRadRabbidRabbit/Team-Lovelace/projects/1) to get a general idea of what each team member is working on.
2. If you are interested in working on something that is not currently a backlog issue, create an issue.
3. After every session of work, pull first. After pulling, you may commit your code. Please do not commit code with errors/that doesn't function properly. Thanks for contributing to Team Lovelace's project!
